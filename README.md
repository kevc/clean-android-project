# Gotchas, etc.

* When necessary, change package names in AndroidManifest.xml
* This project assumes you're going to use the Kotlin programming language (Learn more at: https://kotlinlang.org/)
  * If not, you'll want to remove all kotlin references in `build.gradle` files
  
# The future

I will gradually add branches that build off of one another, in order to demonstrate the goals and best practices of clean architecture in an application context.
